Setup:
1. Set up conda environment with ``conda create -n ecot2 python=3.10``
2. follow https://robosuite.ai/docs/installation.html to set up mujoco ``conda install conda-forge::mujoco-python`` and robosuite (build from source)
3. Set up openvla https://github.com/openvla/openvla in the same conda environment. We are using cuda toolkit 12.4. I recommend just going to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the pytorch part
